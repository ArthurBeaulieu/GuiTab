A tab maker for guitar and bass guitar! Serverless for more pleasure!

Check the [live demo](https://arthurbeaulieu.github.io/GuiTab/)!

It contains the very basics to create guitar and bass guitar tabs ; dynamics, chords, lyrics, tempo updates and time signature updates. You can also declare sections in the tab, in order to jump to them, or to paste them in another place of the tab. Finally, the tab can be played using different sounds (guitar, bass, organ, piano), using synthetic sounds.

This static, serverless website uses the local storage to save the written tabs. It means that your tabs are dependent from the computer you write them from. However, those tab can be saved as a `PDF`, or can be exported as a `JSON` file so they can be loaded in another computer.
